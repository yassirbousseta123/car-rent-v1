# 🚗 Car Rental Internal Management System

## 🎯 Purpose
**Internal management platform for car rental business owners** to prevent revenue loss from unreported extensions and cash collections.

## 🚨 The Problem We Solve
- Workers collect cash for rental extensions and "forget" to report it
- Owner loses $1000+/month in unreported revenue  
- No real-time visibility into operations

## ✅ The Solution
- **Instant alerts** when customers want to extend
- **Payment tracking** until money is collected
- **3-button interface** for lazy workers
- **Complete automation** to prevent mistakes
